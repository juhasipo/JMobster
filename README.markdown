JMobster - Java Model to Backbone.js generator
==============================================
Version preview-alpha 0.2

### Purpose and Current Status

The purpose of this project is to enable automatic model generation from Java POJOs to Backbone.js models. It also
supports client side validation generation from standard JSR-303 validation annotations. At the moment it's still
more of an proof of concept type of project, but in future as I found some use for it may become more mature.

The project has just started so the backwards compatibility may break once in a while due to sudden urges to refactor
the code. The current version is not well tested yet with real Backbone.js client nor a working server so there will
be a lot of bugs.

### Requirements

* JDK 6 (SE or EE)
* Backbone.js (Tested only with 0.9.2)
* [Backbone.Validation](https://github.com/thedersen/backbone.validation) (Tested only with v0.6.2)

At the moment only Java to Backbone.js model conversion is supported. Validation requires
Backbone.Validation plugin to work. Java dependencies are handled in Gradle build file.


Usage
-----

### Basic usage

Basic usage is simple. Create Java classes, use JSR-303 annotations and give the classes to the generator.
```java
public class UserDto {
    @NotNull
    @Size(max = 255)
    private String fullname;

    @NotNull
    @Size(max = 255)
    private String username;

    @NotNull
    @Min(1900)
    private Integer birthYear = 1900;

    @Size(min = 1)
    private String[] roles = { "VIEW_PAGES", "EDIT_OWN_PAGES" };

    // Getters and setters omitted
}
```

JMobster works in two phases. In the first phase JMobster models are generated from Java entities/beans/DTOs with
*ModelFactory*. In the second phase these models are given to JMobster *ModelGenerator* which processes and converts
the given models to appropritate target platform format.

In the next example a *ModelFactory* is created and then it is used to create JMobster models
from three DTO classes:
```java
ModelFactory factory = JMobsterFactory.getModelFactory();
factory.setValidatorFilterGroups( GroupMode.EXACTLY_REQUIRED, Group1.class, Group2.class );

Collection<Model> models = factory.createAll( MyModelDto1.class, MyModelDto2.class, MyModelDto3.class );
```
This *ModelFactory* is same for all target languages and frameworks.

In the next example a *CachedModelProvider* and a *ModelGenerator* is configured which then will take previously created JMobster models:
```java
CachedModelProvider provider = CachedModelProvider.createWithStringWriter( CachedModelProvider.WriteMode.PRETTY );
ModelGenerator generator = JMobsterFactory.getInstance("backbone.js", provider);
generator.processAll( models );
```
This created *ModelGenerator* is language and framework specific. The framework is given as the first parameter. The
second parameter is a *ModelProvider* class or a *DataWriter* which is used for the output. In this case it is a
*CachedModelProvider* which just stores the model as string for later use. Now the *CachedModelProvider* contains our
generated models and can be e.g. written to a file or given via HTTP message by calling `provider.getModel()` method.



### Property Scanning

There are two field scanning mode in JMobster: _DIRECT\_FIELD\_ACCESS_ and _BEAN\_PROPERTY_. The _DIRECT\_FIELD\_ACCESS_
mode is the default mode and in it the fields are find every member variable and use them as model field.
The validator annotations must be written for the member variables. The mode doesn't care about the visibility
of the fields, so all public, protected and private fields are considered equal in that sense.

_BEAN\_PROPERTY_ mode will use standard getter methods to find available model fields (e.g. _getName()_ for field "name").
This mode will ignore _getClass()_ getter. in this mode the annotations must be written to the getter methods in order
them to work since it won't be possible to find the corresponding member variable just with the method name (the getter
can return formatted or combined field data). In this mode, only the public getters are taken into account so any other
getters won't show up in the model.

In the next example a simple class is generated by using the different field scanning modes.

```java
public class ScanningModeDemo {
    @Pattern(regexp = "[\\w]*")
    private String firstName = "John";
    @Pattern(regexp = "[\\w]*")
    private String lastName = "Doe";

    @Size(min = 0, max = 255)
    public String getFullName() {
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    }
}
```

In _DIRECT\_FIELD\_ACCESS_ this will result:

```javascript
var Models = {
    ScanningModeDemo: Backbone.Model.extend({
        validate: {
            firstName: {
                pattern: /[\w]*/
            },
            lastName: {
                pattern: /[\w]*/
            }
        }
    })
};
```

In _BEAN\_PROPERTY_ mode this will result:

```javascript
var Models = {
    ScanningModeDemo: Backbone.Model.extend({
        validate: {
            fullName: {
                maxlength: 255
            }
        }
    })
};
```

In both modes the _IgnoreField_ annotation will ignore the field and it won't be used in the generated model. For
_BEAN\_PROPERTY_ mode the annotations must be written for the getter method and in _DIRECT\_FIELD\_ACCESS_ for the
member variable.


In addition to scanning modes, there are extra settings that determine what kind of fields are included. The current
options are to toggle static and/or final fields. Final field mode affects both scanning modes, but static field mode
only works with _DIRECT\_FIELD\_ACCESS_ mode. By default final fields are included but static fields are not.


Default Process
---------------

JMobster has default implementations for standard JSR-303 validations and a set of default implementations for
processing models. The default classes should work for most cases.

Configuring

### Custom Validators

To support new validators you will have implement several classes.

#### Validator Annotation

The first phase is to create your annotation. The annotation should have a method calles
*groups* which has to return an array of *Classes*. This method is used for filtering annotations
when constructing *ModelFields*.


#### Validator Class

The next phase is to create a wrapper for your annotation. The wrapper will be used in later phase of the process
to get annotation values that should be written to *DataWriter*. These validator wrapper classes are generic and they
only need to be implemented once per annotation.

Here is an example of *MyValidator* for a custom *MyAnnotation* validator annotation:
```java
public class MyValidator extends BaseValidator {
    private String requiredValue;
    private String optionalValue;

    @Override
    public void init( AnnotationBag annotationBag ) {
        MyAnnotation myAnnotation = annotationBag.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
        this.requiredValue = myAnnotation.value();
        if( annotationBag.hasAnnotation(MyOptionalAnnotation.class) ) {
            MyOptionalAnnotation myOptionalAnnotation = annotationBag.getAnnotation(MyOptionalAnnotation.class);
            optionalValue = myOptionalAnnotation.value();
        }
    }

    // Getters
}
```

As you can see, the *MyValidator* contains a two fields *requiredValue* and *optionalValue*. Values is set in the *init* method
which takes an *AnnotationBag* as parameter. *AnnotationBag* contains all the annotations which are required
for your annotation and optional annotations. These required and optional annotations are configured later. Difference
between required and optional annotations is that required annotations are quaranteed to be present when the
*Validator* is initialized. Optional annotations are not.


#### Configuring Required and Optional Annotations

Now that you have your *Validator* class, it requires required and optional annotations. This is done in
*ValidatorFactories*. You have to choises:

1. Use *DefaultValidatorFactory and configure* it to use your own custom validator
2. Create your own *ValidatorFactory* which you configure by yourself

Using the *DefaultValidatorFactory* is the easiest choise and it will contain supported JSR-303 validators. You can
configure like following:

```java
DefaultValidatorFactory validatorFactory = new DefaultValidatorFactory();
validatorFactory.setValidator(MyValidator.class, RequiredTypes.get(MyAnnotation.class), OptionalTypes.get());
```

This will add *MyValidator* class that will require *MyAnnotation* annotation.

#### ValidatorWriter Class

Now that you have your validator configured, you can make your *ValidatorWriter*. *ValidatorWriters* are language
and framework specific. They get previously written *Validator* class as parameter.

Here is an example of a *ValidatorWriter*:
```java
public class MyValidatorWriter extends BaseValidatorWriter<MyValidator, JavaScriptWriter> {
    public MyValidatorWriter() {
        super( MyValidator.class );
    }

    @Override
    protected void write( JavaScriptWriter writer, MyValidator validator, boolean isLast ) {
        String value = validator.getRequiredValue();
        if( validator.hasOptionalValue() ) {
            value += validator.getOptionalValue();
        }
        writer.writeKeyValue("value", value, isLast);
    }
}
```

The example implementation uses higher level *JavaScriptWriter* for output. The first generic parameter
must match your *Validator* (in this case *MyValidator*) and the second must match or be super clasee for
the writer that your framework's *ValidatorWriterManager* uses. More about implementing *ValidatorWriterManager*
is discused in chapter Supporting New Target Framework.

In the constructor you will have to give the type of *Validator* your *ValidatorWriter* supports. This has
to be done manually due to Java's type erasure. The writing itself is implemented in *write* method. You will get
the writer to use and the validator as parameters. There is also *isLast* boolean parameter which is true
if the validator you are writing is the last validator for the current *ModelField*.


**Notice**: *ValidatorWriters* instances are reused so the internal state will stay across calls.


#### Configuring ValidatorWriter to ValidatorWriterManager

Once you have your *ValidatorWriter*, you have to configure *ValidatorWriterManager* to use your *ValidatorWriter*.

```java
ConcreteValidatorWriterManager validatorWriterManager = new ConcreteValidatorWriterManager();
validatorWriterManager.setValidator(new MyValidatorWriter());
```

Now you have added support for your own validation annotation.

### Custom Target Platform

TODO: Intro

#### Supporting New Language

To implement support for new language it is recommended that a customized *DataWriter* is created. JMobster provides
a simple *DataWriter* with few helpful write methods, but a higher level *DataWriter* can be useful.

Custom *DataWriters* have to implement *DataWriter* interface. The implementation itself can rely either on inheritance
or delegation.

TODO: Default value converters

#### Supporting New Target Framework

Supporting a new framework requires implementation of *ValidatorWriters* and *ModelProcessor* interface. Implementing
*ValidatorWriter* classes was covered in Custom Validators chapter. This chapter will cover implementing *ModelProcessor*.

To get started creating a *ModelProcessor*, *BaseModelProcessor* base class can be used. For now it doesn't contain
any functions, but contains the most useful classes that you will need. There are three methods that need to be
implemented: *void startProcessing()*, *void endProcessing()* and *void processModel( Model model, ItemStatus status )*-
The start and end methods are called when processing of all models given for processing is started/ended. *ProcessModel*
method will be called for each model exactly once. Writing the models is usually done in this method and at this phase
the models are already processed so that they contain all necessary fields, validators and annotations etc. so no
filtering should be required.

What you need for your *ModelProcessor* are: *DataWriter* and *ValidatorWriterManager*. *DataWriter* can be a custom
*DataWriter* for a certain language or a generic *DataWriter. Only requirement is that is has to support the
used *ValidatorWriterManager*.

Implementing *ValidatorWriterManager* is quite straight forward. The class has to extend *BaseValidatorWriterManager<W extends DataWriter>*
abstract class where the *W* generic parameter is the *DataWriter* you want to use.

**Notice** *DataWriter* given as generic parameter has to be compatible with your *ValidatorWriters*. What this means
is that if your *ValidatorWriter* requires a writer that implements *DataWriter* but you specify *ValidatorWriterManager*
to use only *DataWriter*, the system won't work because you can't even add your *ValidatorWriters* to *ValidatorWriterManager*.


### Model Naming Strategies

In order to customize the produced model's name, a model naming strategy can be implemented. It basically
takes a Model class and returns the name for the model as string.
